/*express unlike other modules in not an object
but a simple function which ;ets us create servers
and modifie data and use them for backend or 
we can also create websites and use node js as 
a back end for it*/

/*throught this we can build apis and web project
for fetching add or getting data*/

/*
Handle Bar helps us dynamic templating

so in other words lets say we have a website
which has a header and we want the header to
be on all webpages so we are consistent

and it will look good
now to do this we will have to add the header
element to every single html file
which will make the code more complicated
we can solve this by using dynamic templating

in which we already a template to work with
so it will much more easier and faster to
write the webpages

Handle Bar With Express.js integration -->https://www.npmjs.com/package/hbs
